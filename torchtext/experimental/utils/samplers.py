class BucketBatchSampler(Sampler):
    """Defines a batch sampler that batches examples of similar lengths together and
    minimizes amount of padding needed. This BatchSampler works by categorizing each
    raw data by putting them in a bucket whose lengtsh are in the upperbound range of
    ``bucket_boundaries``. For ``bucket_boundaries`` = [5, 10], there will be three
    different buckets that will consist of sentences whose lengths are less than 5,
    between 5 and 10, and more than 10.
    Arguments:
        data_source: data source to sample from.
        bucket_boundaries: upper length boundaries to merge sentences with length
            less than or equal to the boundaries.
        batch_size: size of mini-batch.
            Default: 32
        seq_dim: dimension id where the sequence sizes are located.
            Default: 0
        shuffle: data_source will be wrapped with RandomSampler if set to ``True``,
            otherwise, SequentialSampler. Default: True
    Example:
        >>> dummy = [
            torch.tensor(range(1, torch.randint(2, 11, (1,))[0])) for num in range(10)
        ]
        >>> list(BucketBatchSampler(dummy, [5, 10], batch_size=5, shuffle=False))
        [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9]]
        >>> list(BucketBatchSampler(dummy, [5, 10], batch_size=5))
        [[9, 2, 4, 3, 1], [8, 7, 5, 6], [0]]
